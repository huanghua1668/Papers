decades of research in __cognitive science has shown that humans have early-arising ”start-up” software – rich representations about objects and physics, and about agents, and that humans have the capacity to rapidly acquire new concepts, and build intuitive theories, which they can use to explain, predict, and imagine.__

In addition to bringing early-arising representations to bear on Atari tasks, humans come equipped with rich prior knowledge about the world – for example, knowledge about keys, doors, ice, birds, and so on. While such knowledge could give humans an edge over AI algorithms, we believe that it plays a minimal role in humans’ ability to rapidly master these tasks. Instead, we believe that strong priors specified at a more general level are what give rise to rapid learning. This includes priors about objects as spatiotemporally contiguous entities whose properties can be learned from experience; an imperative to explore these objects and to observe available evidence to rapidly build theory-like models of the Atari worlds they encounter; and an ability to use these models to simulate possible future worlds and generate effective plans.

The __real power of human intuitive theories is that they enable humans to explain the world, generalize from few examples, think counterfactually, and generate effective plans.__
