__Human behavior has long been recognized to display hierarchical structure__: actions fit together into subtasks, which cohere into extended goal-directed activities. Arranging actions hierarchically has well established benefits, allowing behaviors to be represented efficiently by the brain, and allowing solutions to new tasks to be discovered easily. However, these __payoffs depend on the particular way in which actions are organized into a hierarchy__, the specific way in which tasks are carved up into subtasks. We provide a mathematical account for __what makes some hierarchies better than others__

tiered or nested structure is readily apparent in our everyday activities: Turning on the stove forms part of boiling water, which in turn forms part of cooking pasta. 

Not all hierarchies are created equal. The wrong hierarchical representation can actually undermine adaptive behavior.  hierarchy can facilitate learning, it also introduces a new learning problem, the problem of discovering beneficial rather than disruptive subtask representations. Our basic proposal is that the __optimal hierarchy is one that best facilitates adaptive behavior in the face of new problems__. An optimal hierarchy should maximize the efficiency with which an agent can discover new reward-maximizing behaviors.
