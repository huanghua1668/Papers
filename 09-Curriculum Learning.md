Humans and animals learn much better when the examples are not randomly presented but organized in a meaningful order which illustrates gradually more concepts, and gradually more complex ones.

Humans need about two decades to be trained as fully functional adults of our society. That training is highly organized, based on an education system and a curriculum which introduces different concepts at different times, exploiting previously learned concepts to ease the learning of new abstractions.

basic idea is to start small, learn easier aspects of the task or easier subtasks, and then gradually increase the difficulty level.

adaptive value of starting, as human infants do, with a simpler initial state, and then building on that to develop more and more sophisticated representations of structure.
