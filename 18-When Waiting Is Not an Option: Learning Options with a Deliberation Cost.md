what good options should be

__Bounded rationality__ is the idea that __rationality is limited when individuals make decisions__: by the tractability of the decision problem, the __cognitive limitations of the mind, and the time available to make the decision__. Decision-makers, in this view, act as satisficers, seeking a satisfactory solution rather than an optimal one

Recent work has shown that temporally extended actions (options) can be learned fully end-to-end as opposed to being specified in advance.
formulate our answer to what good options should be in the bounded rationality framework (Simon, 1957) through the notion of deliberation
cost.

However, from the point of view of absolute optimality, __temporal abstractions are not necessary: the optimal policy is achieved by primitive actions. Therefore, it has been difficult to formalize in what precise theoretical sense temporally abstract actions are helpful.__

In this paper, we propose bounded rationality as a lens through which we can describe the desiderata for constructing temporal abstractions, as their goal is mainly to help agents which are restricted in terms of computation time. This perspective helps us to formulate more precisely what objective criteria should be fulfilled during option construction. We propose that good options are those which allow an agent to learn and plan faster, and provide an optimization objective for learning options based on this idea.

From a representation learning perspective, good options ought to allow an agent to learn and plan faster (Minsky 1961). Due to their temporal structure, options offer a mechanism through which an agent can make better use of its limited computational resources and act faster.

This perspective on options is similar to fast and frugal heuristics (Gigerenzer and Selten 2001) which form a decision repertoire for efficient decision making under limited resources.
