Integration with a car-following model is achieved by influencing car-following behavior for relaxation and synchronization, that is, following vehicles in adjacent lanes. 

For most lane change models, it holds that gap acceptance either is a simple function of distance and speed difference or is based on a car-following model to determine resulting deceleration. The first class of gap-acceptance models fails to include car-following dynamics, whereas for the latter class it is assumed that drivers accept smaller gaps through a larger acceptable deceleration. However, in the real world, drivers largely will apply small decelerations and will accept smaller time headways for a while, as is shown empirically for merging traffic (10). This phenomenon is known as relaxation

Another important aspect of lane changing is lane change preparation, sometimes referred to as the tactical stage (6), in which drivers may adapt their speed and align with a gap and in which another driver may create a gap. This lane change preparation is referred to as synchronization, as drivers synchronize with an adjacent lane. 

Most lane change models classify lane changes by the reason for which they are performedâ€”mandatory, discretionary, courtesy, and so forth (18). Here, lane changes are classified by the way in which they are prepared and performed. This is called a lane change process, and different processes are performed for different levels of desire.


Classification of lane changes is based on this behavior. Free lane changes (dfree), synchronized lane changes (dsync), and cooperative lane changes (dcoop) are distinguished.  For little desire, no lane change will be performed. For a somewhat larger desire, a free lane change is performed that requires no preparation. For synchronized lane changes and cooperative lane changes, a potential lane changer is willing to synchronize speed with the target lane. This is achieved by following a vehicle in that lane. Concurrently this will align the vehicle with a gap (if there is a gap); this is thus a simple gap-searching model. In cooperative lane changes, the potential follower also will start to create a gap by following the potential lane changer. This behavior is also called synchronization and may be triggered for several reasons, such as the use of a turn indicator or the lateral in-lane position.
