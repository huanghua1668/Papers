Integration with a car-following model is achieved by influencing car-following behavior for relaxation and synchronization, that is, following vehicles in adjacent lanes. 

For most lane change models, it holds that gap acceptance either is a simple function of distance and speed difference or is based on a car-following model to determine resulting deceleration. The first class of gap-acceptance models fails to include car-following dynamics, whereas for the latter class it is assumed that drivers accept smaller gaps through a larger acceptable deceleration. However, in the real world, drivers largely will apply small decelerations and will accept smaller time headways for a while, as is shown empirically for merging traffic (10). This phenomenon is known as relaxation

Another important aspect of lane changing is lane change preparation, sometimes referred to as the tactical stage (6), in which drivers may adapt their speed and align with a gap and in which another driver may create a gap. This lane change preparation is referred to as synchronization, as drivers synchronize with an adjacent lane.
